Introduce myself.
Welcome to Lincoln Institute's new learning platform, Bridge.
Bridge is an intuitive platform where your practice will now be able to 
access all of Lincoln's content in a simple and effective way.
As administrators for your practice, these videos will outline how you can
make the most out of what this platform has to offer.
You're going to get 5 videos which explain the following features and functions:
how to add a team member, how to allocate team members to courses, how to use the calendar and what is for,
and lastly, how to use the Insights tab (which Paul will be putting together)
